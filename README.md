####CTEC3905 Assignment - Website

For the theme of my project I have decided to create a portfolio website, which allow the reader to see what the company is doing, some info about its team and contact form.
My website project focuses on a minimalist look, which makes it looking both simply and attractive. Website is fully responsive to the different screen sizes, as it was built on the mobile-first basis. Site has a breakdown for the screens larger than 800px.

**Navigation**
Website uses so-called 'hamburger' navigation, with three bars appearing in the left top corner. When clicked, the menu shows up with three different sections of the website:
- Home
- About
- Contact

Navigation is achieved by using javascript code contained in the 'navanim.js' file. Moreover, when hovered over it uses an animation for the elements moving from the left hand side towards the middle.
In order to maintain the minimalistic look of the website I have decided to leave the same menu style for the desktop version as well. The only thing I have changed to show my understanding of the breakpoint points and adaptation to the different screen sizes are the colors of the elements and the point towards which they move in a simple animation.

**Structure**
Website's html is divided into sections, which in my opinion are easier to understand for the reader and more simple to maintain in CSS. Sections are:
- Head
- Content1
- Content2
- Content3
- Content4
- Content5
- Button

On the website I have used few buttons, with different features, which make it easier to navigate around the site.

**Contact**
On the contact subpage I have included a form, which allows the user to contact the company.
It was achieved by using javascript in the 'contact.js' file.

**Scroll**
Website has multiple buttons used to navigate around the site. At the bottom, there is a button to scroll the page to the top, achieved with javascript included in file 'scroll.js'.

**Google Maps**
Website uses Google Maps API at the bottom of the page, in order to present the current location of the company.

**Testing**
Website was tested using different screen sizes and devices. The devices included:
- Lenovo Yoga 700 14''
- iPhone 6
- iPhone 7
- iPhone 5s
- Samsung UE49MU6670 TV''49
- Samsung Galaxy S8

User testing was without any problems, website is fast, responsive and adapts easily to different screen sizes.

**Future_Work**
In the future, website could include more subsites, with the previous work examples.
It can be achieved by adding galleries and videos/YouTube videos
